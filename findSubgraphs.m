% Recursive function called by getSubgraphs.m.  By Mark Ebden, October 2014.
% Inputs a 1xn vector (pN) of what nodes have been tapped in the past.
% The 'statics' are, for each of the provenance graph and the subgraph:
% adjacency matrix, node types, node attributes, and node names.
% Outputs an m-column matrix (indTot) of possible 1xm mappings of H to G.
% Also outputs a success indicator (returnCode) which is '1' if an 
% additional subgraph has been found in that function call.
